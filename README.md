# mini-project-olympics-2016

This ETL process looks at data from from two different tables, one being 2016 Olympics and the other is the Olympics between 1976-2008.

We took our dataset, cleaned the data by altering values, changing column names, deleteing unused columns, and adding new ones.

After the data was cleaned and matched each other we merged then together to create one big data source.

Finally we loaded the data to PostgresSQL where it can be queried either in PGAdmin or in Jupyter Notebook.
